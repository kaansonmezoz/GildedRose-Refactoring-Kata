============================================
Gilded Rose Requirements Specification
============================================

    - Small Inn
    - Inkeeper: Allison
    - Buys & sells goods
    - Qualify of bought goods degrade as the time is passed.

    - Item:
        - SellIn value: the number of days is left to sell the item. (sell by date)
        - Quality value: how valuable the item is
        - At the end of each day both values are lowered for every item.
        - The Quality of an item is never negative
        - The Quality of an item is never more than 50
        - Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast

    - Exceptions:
        - "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
        - "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
        - "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as its SellIn value approaches;
	        - Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
	        - Quality drops to 0 after the concert
        - An item can never have its Quality increase above 50, however "Sulfuras" is a legendary item and as such
          its Quality is 80 and it never alters.

    - Task: Add new feature => Enables to sell items from a new category
        - A deal has been signed with conjured items supplier.
        - "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

    * Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and add any new code as long as everything still works correctly
    * However, do not alter the Item class or Items property as those belong to the goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you
      as he doesn't believe in shared code ownership (you can make the UpdateQuality method and Items property static if you like, we'll cover for you).
